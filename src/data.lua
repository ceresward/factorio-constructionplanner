-- TODO: Improved graphics for the shortcut and/or selection-tool, maybe thumbnail as well?
-- TODO: Find some way for the placeholders to have a proper selection border during BP/decon/approval selection
    -- Prototype would likely need a selection_box.  But how to work around the fact that the placeholder remains mineable?
    -- Maybe just work with the mineable placeholder, and use some sort of rendering trick to make it look like the placeholder is the real deal, instead of trying to hide it
    -- But that might not work well with wires/circuits/etc...it may be difficult/brittle to accurately fake those
    -- Also, quick-select might prove tricky...would need to be able to intercept the event on the placeholder and replace it with the real deal
